# Lip_Reading_from_Video

This is a computer vision and pattern recognition project which describes the process of predicting the words spoken from the video by processing the movements of the lips. The dataset was preprocessed in order to remove the irrelevant details from the input image frames. Sequence classification labelling was carried out with the preprocessed dataset as each word utterance is a sequence of image frames. The labelled data is further trained with the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with Time distributed layer. The testing produced an accuracy of 71%.
